# EvenRealm (Under development)

EvenRealm is a game being developed in my free time as a learning project. It uses the **Godot Engine**, a free and open source game engine (https://godotengine.org) 

I'm a developer not an artist, all the art used is heavily inspired by the game OddRealm (https://www.oddrealmgame.com/). 

## Current state of the game

* Hexagonal map
	* Dynamic tiles
	* Multiple biomes
